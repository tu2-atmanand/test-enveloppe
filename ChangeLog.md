## 6.x releases

- 6.1.0:
  - Add support for [task dependencies](task%20dependencies.md):
    - First, [use 'Create or edit Task'](Create%20or%20edit%20Task.md#Dependencies) to define the order in which you want to work on a set of tasks, using two new task emojis: ðŸ†”  and â›”.
    - Then adjust your searches, perhaps to see tasks that are [blocking others](Filters.md#Blocking%20Tasks), or hide ones that are [blocked](Filters.md#Blocked%20Tasks) and cannot yet be done.
  - `query.allTasks` is now available in custom searches: see [query search properties](Query%20Properties.md#Values%20for%20Query%20Search%20Properties).
  - The [Create or edit Task](Create%20or%20edit%20Task.md) modal now fully supports editing of statuses, updating done and cancelled dates, and creating new recurrences. See the [section on editing statuses](Create%20or%20edit%20Task.md#Status) for details and tips.
  - Add HTML samples in [full](Styling.md#Sample%20HTML%20Full%20mode) and [short](Styling.md#Sample%20HTML%20Short%20mode) modes to demonstrate custom styling.
- 6.0.0:
  - Add [custom sorting](Custom%20Sorting.md).
  - Document the [default sort order](Sorting.md#Default%20sort%20order).
  - **Warning**: This release contains some **bug-fixes** to **sorting** and to treatment of **invalid dates**.
    - The changes are detailed in [breaking changes](Breaking%20Changes.md#Tasks%206.0.0%20(19%20January%202024)), even though they are all improvements to the previous behaviour.
    - You may need to update any CSS snippets for the Edit or Postpone buttons: see [How to style buttons](How%20to%20style%20buttons.md).
